# RandomCV
Consists of Two unrelated pages.
First part is brushing up some HTML and CSS while creating a Cirriculumn Vitae (which is nowhere complete)
Following the link that appears above the CV, you can go to a random number selector, in which you pick a number and see if the computer had pick the same number. This is an attempt to get familiar with JavaScript event handling and getting familiar with DOM of the webpage.
